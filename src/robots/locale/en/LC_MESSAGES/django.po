"Between 0.1 and 99.0. This field is supported by some search engines and "

"crawler rate is a problem for your server, you can set the delay up to 5 or "
"10 or a comfortable value for your server, but it's suggested to start with "
"small values (0.5-1), and increase as needed to an acceptable value for your "
"server. Larger delay values add more delay between successive crawl accesses "
"and decrease the maximum crawl rate to your web server."
