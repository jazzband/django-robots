6.0 (2023-09-07)
----------------

Breaking change: Missing ``DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This sets a ``DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`` to ``BigAutoField`` for robots in ``AppConfig``. Previously,
there was no app configuration or setting for this. (#134, thank you @jan-szejko-steelseries)

Robots 5.0 included a ``BigAutoField`` migration file for django 3.2 support (see #112),
however, this caused an extra migration to be created to set ``django.db.models.AutoField``
for certain users (see #124).

**Breaking: Migration issues**

New django sites should work fine.

*Existing sites that manually created migrations for robots 5.0:*

If you ran ``./manage.py makemigrations`` to bypass the #112 issue, you may need to resolve
this manually if a custom migration you made for robots was applied in ``django_migrations``.
